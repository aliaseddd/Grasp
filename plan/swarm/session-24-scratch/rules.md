## The rules, with their reasons

1. **Change only the files you own.** Other agents are changing the others at the same time, and the lead takes only your owned files.
2. **Nothing under `canvas/src`, `canvas/test`, or any other file listed in `canvas/app/test/unchanged.json`.** One changed byte there fails `unchanged.test.mjs`: the old page, the library and their tests stay as slice 1 found them.
3. **No new package, and no import of a library that `canvas/app/src/vendor.ts` does not hold.** The build refuses it. An import you need and cannot make is a reason to stop.
4. **No test is loosened, skipped or marked todo.** A signature, a contract or a test that looks wrong is a reason to stop and say why. Do not work around it.
5. **No colour outside `canvas/app/src/shell/theme.ts`; no test reads `window.Grasp`; no test turns on the CSS domain of the DevTools protocol.** Colours in one file keep the look in one place until slice 7. `window.Grasp` is for looking, and a test that reads it tests the page's inside, not what a person meets. The CSS domain makes Chromium log an error on a page opened from `file://`, which every browser test would then report.

Two more things, of judgment:

- **Tests check the code and do not define it.** The contract is the comment in the skeleton and the step's file. When a test and the contract disagree, the contract stands and the test is wrong.
- **Something that looks wrong is a reason to stop.** If you find a signature, a contract or a test wrong, stop and say what you found and why. Do not change a file you do not own, and do not bend your own work to fit.
